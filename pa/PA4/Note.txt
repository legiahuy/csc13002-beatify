For this PA submission, we have updated the Software Architecture Document to address the teacher's feedback. 
The updates include ensuring consistency in the format of all diagrams and reorganizing the class diagrams into appropriate packages. 
These revisions aim to improve the clarity and organization of the document, ensuring it provides a more accurate and structured representation of the system's architecture.
